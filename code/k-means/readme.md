Run python word2vec.py

It will not work as is, because we have not included the copora or known codewords here for safety reasons.
It runs the word2vec model on specified files that have been scraped from online, training the word2vec neural net.
Then it will run this through k-means to cluster the word vectors, outputting results into a "results.txt" file, also not
included here.
